`CompletableFuture` offers significant advantages over `Future` in Java, primarily by enabling asynchronous, non-blocking, and compositional programming. In contrast to `Future`, which has limited capabilities for handling asynchronous tasks, `CompletableFuture` provides a more powerful and flexible API to chain tasks, handle errors, and process results once tasks are completed, all without blocking the main thread.

### Key Benefits of `CompletableFuture` over `Future`:

1. **Non-Blocking Behavior**:
   - With `Future`, you typically block the thread when calling `get()` to retrieve the result of an asynchronous computation.
   - `CompletableFuture` allows non-blocking operations, where you can specify actions to be taken when the result is available, without blocking the main thread.

2. **Chaining and Composition of Tasks**:
   - `CompletableFuture` allows you to chain multiple asynchronous tasks together using methods like `thenApply()`, `thenAccept()`, and `thenCompose()`. This makes it easier to perform a sequence of dependent tasks.
   - `Future` doesn’t provide a clean mechanism to chain operations or combine multiple `Future` objects.

3. **Combining Multiple Futures**:
   - `CompletableFuture` has methods like `thenCombine()`, `allOf()`, and `anyOf()`, which allow combining the results of multiple asynchronous operations.
   - `Future` lacks built-in support for combining or coordinating multiple asynchronous tasks.

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - `CompletableFuture` has built-in methods for handling exceptions asynchronously, such as `handle()`, `exceptionally()`, and `whenComplete()`, making error handling in asynchronous code easier and more readable.
   - With `Future`, you would need to handle exceptions manually by catching them when calling `get()`.

5. **Asynchronous Task Execution**:
   - `CompletableFuture` can start tasks asynchronously using `runAsync()` and `supplyAsync()`, without needing to manually manage an `ExecutorService`.
   - `Future` doesn’t provide direct support for starting tasks asynchronously. It requires explicit submission of tasks to an `ExecutorService`.

6. **Completion of Futures Manually**:
   - `CompletableFuture` allows you to complete the future programmatically using methods like `complete()`, `completeExceptionally()`, and `obtrudeValue()`.
   - `Future` doesn’t allow manual completion. Once a task is submitted to an executor, you can only wait for it to complete.

### Examples Illustrating the Benefits:

#### 1. **Non-Blocking and Chaining Tasks**:

With `Future`, if you want to retrieve the result, you block the current thread using `get()`:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulating long-running task
    return 10;
});

// This blocks until the future completes
int result = future.get();
System.out.println("Result: " + result);

executor.shutdown();
```

This blocks the thread while waiting for the task to complete.

---

With `CompletableFuture`, you can chain tasks without blocking:

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulating long-running task
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return 10;
});

// Chain another task
future.thenApply(result -> result * 2) // Multiplies the result by 2
      .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result)); // Prints the result

// No need to block here, the result is processed asynchronously
```

In this case, the main thread doesn’t block and can continue other work, while the result is handled once it's available.

---

#### 2. **Combining Multiple `CompletableFutures`**:

Suppose you have two asynchronous tasks and you want to combine their results. With `Future`, this can be cumbersome:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

Future<Integer> future1 = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return 10;
});

Future<Integer> future2 = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(2000);
    return 20;
});

// Blocking to wait for both futures to complete
int result = future1.get() + future2.get();
System.out.println("Combined Result: " + result);

executor.shutdown();
```

---

With `CompletableFuture`, you can easily combine the results using `thenCombine()`:

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return 10;
});

CompletableFuture<Integer> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(2000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return 20;
});

// Combine the results of both futures
CompletableFuture<Integer> combinedFuture = future1.thenCombine(future2, (result1, result2) -> result1 + result2);

combinedFuture.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Combined Result: " + result));
```

This allows both futures to run in parallel, and their results are combined asynchronously without blocking.

---

#### 3. **Handling Exceptions Asynchronously**:

With `Future`, you need to handle exceptions synchronously when calling `get()`:

```java
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    throw new RuntimeException("Exception occurred!");
});

try {
    future.get();
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
    System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getCause());
}
```

---

With `CompletableFuture`, you can handle exceptions asynchronously using `exceptionally()`:

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    throw new RuntimeException("Exception occurred!");
});

future.exceptionally(ex -> {
    System.out.println("Caught exception: " + ex.getMessage());
    return null; // Handle exception
});
```

This allows you to specify an exception handler without blocking the thread or cluttering the logic with `try-catch`.

---

#### 4. **Manual Completion of `CompletableFuture`**:

With `CompletableFuture`, you can complete a future manually. This is useful in scenarios where an asynchronous task may finish early, or where you want to manually signal completion based on some condition:

```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();

// Complete it manually
future.complete("Manual completion!");

// Alternatively, complete it exceptionally
// future.completeExceptionally(new RuntimeException("Manual exception"));

future.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result));
```

With `Future`, you can't manually complete the future, which limits its flexibility.

| **Task starting**                 | Requires submission to an executor                 | Supports `runAsync()` and `supplyAsync()`               |

In summary, `CompletableFuture` is much more powerful and flexible than `Future`, particularly for building complex, non-blocking, and asynchronous workflows.
